## GitHub Community Leader Selection and Onboarding processes

There are two main ways to become a GitTogether Community Leader. The first is through self-nomination. If an individual believes they have what it takes to lead and inspire others, they can fill out the [self-nomination form](/leader-selection/selfnom-form.md) and provide information about their background, experience, and motivation for becoming a leader.

The second way is through direct contact by one of GitTogether's Developer Relations (DevRel) leads via an [application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePvf_R13rNQ4Jwpx4_K7Bw4X2vJ4zqvIkTlbeN_kUjA-MEpw/viewform). The DevRel team is constantly on the lookout for potential leaders who have demonstrated a strong commitment to the GitHub community or have been recommended by fellow GitHubbers. If they feel an individual would be a great fit for the program, they may reach out to them directly.

Once accepted into the program, new community leaders fill out the official [onboarding form](/leader-selection/onboarding-form.md), this will kick off the onboarding process and set them up for success. This includes a virtual orientation session, where they learn more about GitTogether's goals and expectations, as well as training sessions on topics like event organization and community engagement.

To ensure a smooth transition, new community leaders work closely with their DevRel lead who guides them through their first few months and helps them set goals and create an action plan.
